## Features in Detail

### üß† **Auto-Learning System**
The bot automatically analyzes every message to detect interesting personal information about users and remembers it for future conversations. 

**What it learns:**
- Professional information (job, skills, company)
- Personal interests and hobbies
- Location and background
- Preferences and experiences
- Educational details

**How it works:**
1. User mentions the bot in a message
2. AI analyzes if the message contains personal information worth remembering
3. If yes: Automatically stores the information using the remember system
4. If no: Continues with normal conversation
5. Future conversations include this learned context

### üìù **Manual Remember System**

## Commands

### `/remember`
Store personal information about yourself or someone else that the bot will remember for future interactions.

**Usage:** 
- `/remember information:"Your information here"` - Store info about yourself
- `/remember information:"Some information" user:@SomeUser` - Store info about another user

**Features:**
- Store information about yourself or other Discord users
- If no information exists, the AI will format and organize the new information
- If information already exists, the AI will intelligently combine new information with existing data
- The bot uses AI to avoid duplicates and organize information coherently
- Information is stored persistently in the database and used in future conversations
- When mentioning users in chat, Macron will reference what he knows about them
